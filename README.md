## Synopsis

This project is attempt to built clear and simple webpack config, with no extra complexity.

## Motivation

There is a lot of webpack configs. Many of them use a lot features in one time, another try separate one config to hundreds of tiny modules. And it's so hard for newcomers to get all this stuff. So, my mission is simplify process.

## Installation

`npm i` do the all stuff!

## API Reference

So, want to play with it?

`npm start` to run only the frontend dev server on http://localhost:3000
`nnpm test-server` to run only the [json-server](https://github.com/typicode/json-server) which serves data from [MOCK_DATA.json](https://github.com/jaxxreal/react-training-day/blob/master/MOCK_DATA.json) (it contains 1000 mocked user objects)
`npm run start-dev` to run frontend and json-server to mock requests
`npm build` to "bake" your application (it will become ready for deploy)
